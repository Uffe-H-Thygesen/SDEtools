Description: This package contains a number of utilities for analysis of stochastic differential equations. These include simulation of sample paths of Brownian motion, numerical stochastic integration, numerical solution of stochastic differential equations, and numerical analysis of the Kolmogorov equations in one and two spatial dimensions, including applications to filtering (recursive state estimation) and optimal control.
