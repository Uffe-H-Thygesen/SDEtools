\title{Estimate states in a scalar stochastic differential equation based on discretization to a HMM}
\usage{
HMMfilterSDE(
  u,
  D,
  xi,
  bc,
  x0dist,
  tvec,
  yvec,
  lfun,
  do.smooth = FALSE,
  do.Viterbi = FALSE,
  pfun = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{function mapping state (numeric scalar) to advective term (numeric scalar)}

\item{D}{function mapping state (numeric scalar) to diffusivity (numeric scalar)}

\item{xi}{The numerical grid. Numeric vector of increasing values, giving cell boundaries}

\item{bc}{String indicating boundary conditions. See details.}

\item{x0dist}{Prior distribution of the initial state, specified as a c.d.f. or as a vector of same length as xi, start}

\item{tvec}{Vector of (increasing) time points where observations are taken}

\item{yvec}{Vector of observations at each time point}

\item{lfun}{Likelihood function so that lfun(x,y) gives the likelihood of y given x}

\item{do.smooth}{Do want smoothing, or only predictive filtering / estimation?}

\item{do.Viterbi}{Do we want the most probable state sequence, found with the Viterbi algorithm?}

\item{pfun}{C.d.f. of observations given states, i.e. pfun(x,y) gives P(Y<=y | X = x). If supplied, pseudo-prediction residuals will be computed}
}
\value{
A list containing:
phi A tabulation of the predicitive probability densities
psi A tabulation of the estimated probability densities
pi  (If do.smooth==TRUE) A tabulation of the smoothed probability densities
c   A vector containing the normalization constants at each time step
}
\description{
