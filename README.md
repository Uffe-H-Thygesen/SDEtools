SDEtools provides functions for analyzing models based on stochastic differential equations (SDE's). These analysis include simulation of sample paths, solving the Kolmogorov equations that govern transition probabilities, state estimation, and optimal control.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SDEtools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Uffe-H-Thygesen/SDEtools")
```
